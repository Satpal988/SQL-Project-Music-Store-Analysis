# SQL-Project-Music-Store-Analysis
# Project Overview
This project involves analyzing a music store database to uncover key business insights and improve decision-making processes. By leveraging SQL and advanced query techniques, I explored various dimensions of the music store's operations, including employee hierarchy, customer distribution, revenue analysis, and customer preferences.

# Objectives
The primary goal of this project was to analyze the dataset and answer critical business questions, such as:

Who is the senior-most employee based on job title?
Which countries have the most invoices, and what does this reveal about customer distribution?
What are the top 3 invoices by total value?
Which city generates the highest revenue, and how can this insight help plan events?
Who is the best customer based on spending patterns?
What are the most popular genres and artists?
Which tracks exceed the average song length, and how can they be used to create special playlists?
